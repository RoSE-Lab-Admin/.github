# 🌌 Robotic Space Exploration (RoSE) Lab @ Colorado School of Mines

Welcome to the **RoSE Lab GitHub Organization**, led by Dr. **Frances “Frankie” Zhu**, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. We build intelligent robotic systems to explore extreme space environments— from orbital satellites to lunar/Martian rovers and sub-surface explorers.

## 🧩 Research Mission

Our goal is to push the frontiers of **robotic autonomy in space**, marrying:
- **Dynamics & control systems**
- **Machine learning for real‑time decision making**
- **Terramechanics and multisensor perception**
- **Digital-twin simulation (e.g., Isaac Sim, ROS2)**
- **Field and hardware experimentation** in lunar-analog environments :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

We design algorithms that enable robots to understand and adapt to unknown terrain in real time, empowering them to:
- Traverse lunar/Martian regolith
- Conduct scientific exploration in GNSS-denied settings
- Support future Artemis missions from orbit to subsurface :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
